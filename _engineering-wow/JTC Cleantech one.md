### LIVING, BREATHING BUSINESS PARK

Singapore's first eco-business park, CleanTech Park, is an R&D and test-bedding site for early adoption of technology and solutions. Located beside the Nanyang Technological University, the 50-hectare park was developed with an emphasis on retaining the natural environment and biodiversity of the area, and serves as a choice location for forward-looking corporations that embrace environmental sustainability.

A gateway into CleanTech Park, the 37,500 m2 JTC CleanTech One is a living capsule that is both efficient and sustainable, demonstrating that environmental sustainability is economical and can be easily applied to everyday life. Its green features, including energy-efficient LED lighting, sensor-controlled dimming and switching capabilities and solar panels, translate to cost savings for the eco-friendly community. It is also the first building to be awarded the BCA Green Mark Platinum Award for New Non-Residential Building, the highest accolade for green buildings in Singapore.
#### SMART GREEN THINKING
The living atrium at the centre of the building not only provides the main thoroughfare for people to access the building, it also serves as a green link way for visitors to connect to the adjacent Jurong Eco-Garden. Apart from the extensive landscaping surrounding the building and the living atrium, sky gardens were also built into every level to create breakout spaces for the occupants. These sky gardens were placed in strategic locations, mainly along the Eastern and Western facades so that the plants could buffer the tenanted areas from direct sunlight and glare, thus reducing the energy needed to cool their spaces within the building.
#### SUN & WIND STRATEGIES
Sun shading simulation was performed to analyse the effects of shading provided by the building at different times of the year. This analysis enabled designers to orientate the building in an optimal way so that the atrium could receive sufficient shading as well as day lighting throughout the year.
Photosynthetically Active Radiation Analysis was done to study the amount of sunlight the green walls would receive so that the right type of plants could grow on them.
Wind Analysis was carried out and a ‘Wind Wall’ was created to enhance natural ventilation within the living atrium. Using the Venturi wall principle, the building was designed to channel airflow into desired areas. This reduces the need for mechanical ventilation (fans) or even air conditioning for common areas.
#### NOT JUST ENERGY SAVING BUT ALSO POWER GENERATING
The chilled water piping layouts in the development were arranged to minimise 90 degree bends by incorporating 45 degree bends and shorter pipe lengths. This reduces the system frictional losses in the piping networks, which in turn reduces the pumping power required.

Energy efficient LED lighting for all common areas including landscape areas are controlled through the Building Management System, photocell as well as motion sensors, which yields an estimated 22.35% lighting power savings.

Lifts were provided with Variable Voltage Variable Frequency (VVVF) drive and escalators with dual speed with motion sensor. VVVF Lift Drive regulates input voltage and frequency during the operation of the lifts and strives to optimise it. The lift will be in sleep mode when there is no one using the lift. The lights and ventilation will be switched off until someone uses the lift. As a result, energy efficiency is achieved.

2,000 m2 of roof space were set aside for monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar PVs. New technologies like thin film and nano-structured printed PV Innovative means of installing photovoltaic panels (PV) were also explored i.e. having PV integrated with the façade roof cladding, on curved roofs, on fixed structures and movable structures. These features led to 261,800 kWh/yr of renewable energy harvested.

All other building services equipment, such as air handling units, mechanical ventilation fans and pumps were designed to operate efficiently too. The target energy savings for the building is 63.14% as compared to the reference building in accordance to BCA Green Mark Platinum requirement
#### TAPPING INTO WATER EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES
All tap fittings, urinal and urinal flushing are rated Excellent, which is the highest rating under the Water Efficiency Labelling System (WELS).

Rainwater harvesting helps to create water savings of approximately 20% of the building’s water needs, which is 16.3 m3 per month. Rainwater collected at the roof is used for irrigation of the landscaping.

Grey water recycling system was also put in place to collect condensate discharge from air-conditioning system and hand wash basin wastewater. These collected grey water will be treated and used for water closet flushing purposes. This constitutes another 18% savings of the total building water consumption.
#### IT’S DOWN TO THE MATERIALS SELECTION
Internal roads, connecting sewers and drains were constructed using certified green materials such as the eco-concrete and green concrete. Other initiatives include the selection of materials with high recycled contents such as homogeneous tiles, precast concrete wall, carpet and calcium silicate board, etc.

Environmentally friendly concretes were used for non-structural as well as structural works and involved the partial substitution of natural concrete constituents with recycled concrete aggregate. Structural green concrete was used extensively for many structural elements (bored piles, pile caps, columns/walls, beams, and slabs). Furthermore, the formwork used during construction was a proprietary system which allowed for faster casting, better quality of form finish but also lower material wastage
