### GUARDIAN OF THE SEA

To tackle the challenges of detecting underwater mines in local waters, DSO National Laboratories (DSO) developed the Meredith 400 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with advanced sonar payloads that can rapidly scan large swaths of seabed for underwater threats. It is able to operate in the congested waters of Singapore and uses state-of-the-art sonar imaging sensors and algorithms. The development of an AUV for mine countermeasures was made possible by a team of engineers specialised in different skills and knowledge. In recognition of its efforts, the DSO team was awarded the 2015 Defence Technology Prize (Research & Development) Team Award.

#### AVOIDING OBSTACLES IN BUSY SEA WATERS
To operate autonomously and confidently in the congested waters of Singapore, the Meredith 400 AUV uses the obstacle avoidance capability developed by DSO to navigate safely around obstacles. It uses its forward-looking sonar to detect obstacles and its obstacle avoidance algorithm to steer the AUV away from obstacles and define a new path for the AUV to accomplish its mission. The DSO team also used hydrodynamic studies and computer simulation models to analyse and improve the AUVâ€™s design and swimming dynamics

#### SEEING WHAT THE EYES CANNOT
The advanced sonar imaging equipment on-board the Meredith 400 AUV uses Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technology to provide high-resolution sea bottom images. This enables the AUV to scan large areas of seabed for sea mines. To ease the workload of manned mine countermeasures by the Singapore Armed Forces, the DSO team developed advanced sonar processing algorithms to sieve out and highlight mine-like objects in sonar images. With these algorithms, the amount of sonar images that need to be analysed by AUV operators when searching for mines is significantly reduced. Besides detecting sea mines, the high resolution SAS images can also be used for civilian operations like shipwreck surveillance and search-and-rescue operations.
